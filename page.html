  <li>Deuce: When both players are tied at 40-40. A deuce can be ended when a player scores two more consecutive points</li>
  <li>Ad-in or advantage: Used when players are in a deuce and the server needs only one more point to win</li>

Rules
</h2>
<p>
There are rules and regulations that must be followed in matches.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the ball lands on the line, it is counted in</li>
  <li>The first serve must always start on the right hand side and served overhand into the diagonal service box</li>
  <li>The score of the person serving is announced first, then the score of the opponent, followed by "first serve" or "second serve" depending if a fault was used during that game</li>
  <li>In a singles match, both players switch to the other baseline side after each point is scored</li>
  <li>In a doubles match, the players that are serving switch baselines while the recievers remain stationary</li>
  <li>Players switch to the opposite side of the court when the total games played is odd</li>
  <li>A serve can be returned only after it hits the ground once, but after the serve is returned, the ball can be hit in the air</li>
  <li>The ball can only hit the ground once. If it bounces twice, the point goes to the opposing player</li>
  <li>The server is allowed one two faults on each serve. If the server messes up both faults, the point is awarded to the opponent</li>
 </ol>
