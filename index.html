      What is Tennis?
    </h3>
    <p>
Tennis, originally named lawn tennis, is a game in which two opposing players (singles) or pairs of players (doubles) use tautly strung rackets to hit a ball and bounce over a net on a rectangular court.

      The History of Tennis
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the first few centuries in which tennis was played, the ball was struck with the palm of the hand. As the game became more popular, courtyard playing areas began to be modified into indoor courts where the ball was still played off the walls. After bare hands were found too uncomfortable, players began using a glove, then either a glove with webbing between the fingers or a solid paddle, followed by webbing attached to a handle, essentially a racquet. The early game matured into what is now called "real tennis." In 1874, Major Walter C. Wingfield patented, in London, the equipment and rules for a game very similar to modern tennis. In the same year, the first tennis courts appeared in the United States. By the following year, equipment sets had been sold for use in Russia, India, Canada, and China. <br/>
